FullStack Developer  
===================

Requirement
------------
Build an App for Email service. The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!

### Email Service
Create a service that accepts the necessary information from the user and sends emails. Pick one of the email service providers.

Email Providers:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html)

All listed services are free to try, so please register your own test accounts as required.

Technical Spec
--------------
The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end app.

### Back-end
Choose any technical stack to build the application which connects with email service providers. Please do write a `README` on why a technology stack was chosen. You are also free to use any web framework/libraries.

Below are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Clojure
* Java

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a single page app where you can use any external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

Additional Bonus Point
----------------------

When youâ€™re completed the app, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Digital Ocean & Heroku).
